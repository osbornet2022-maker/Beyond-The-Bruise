    <h2>Artists’ Statement</h2>
    <p class="statement">
        <em>Beyond The Bruise</em> explores the world of Mathew Wagy, a former professional MMA fighter who 
        has transformed his experience inside the cage into a life centered around mentorship. His gym in 
        Deerfield Beach serves as more than a training space—it is a sanctuary where ambition is sharpened, 
        vulnerabilities are confronted, and perseverance is built through sweat and bruises. The documentary 
        presents Mathew not as a fighter chasing past glory, but as a coach shaping the future of the sport.
    </p>

    <p class="statement">
        This film aims to spotlight the emotional weight behind physical discipline. The minimalist aesthetic 
        reflects the quiet intensity of Mathew’s approach: no theatrics, no spectacle—just raw commitment. 
        Through intimate visuals and grounded storytelling, <em>Beyond The Bruise</em> seeks to honor the 
        invisible battles behind every athlete’s journey and the mentors who guide them through it.
